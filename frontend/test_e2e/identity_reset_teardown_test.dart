// §6.2 identity reset, END TO END against a real backend and a real Postgres:
// the roster teardown (amendment (f)/(xxviii)) and falsification 12, the
// per-device epoch claim.
//
//   docker-compose up
//   cd frontend && flutter test test_e2e/identity_reset_teardown_test.dart \
//     --dart-define=RESET_PROBE=true
//
// WHY THIS IS OPT-IN, and it is not squeamishness. Two hard constraints:
//
//  1. `/auth/register` is 10 per HOUR per IP and — with no nginx in front —
//     every account in `test_e2e/` shares one bucket. Measured 2026-08-22: the
//     default run already spends it to the edge, and adding a THIRD account to
//     `full_stack_e2e_test.dart` pushed `takeover_alarm_test.dart` into
//     `ThrottlerException` on register. So a new account cannot simply be added
//     to the shared suite; the alternative was raising a production anti-abuse
//     cap to fit a test, which is not a trade this program makes.
//  2. The ceremony is DESTRUCTIVE. It replaces the account identity, revokes
//     every device and burns a device id forward permanently. It therefore
//     needs an account nothing else depends on — never a shared fixture.
//
// It follows the house pattern for probes with special preconditions
// (`seed_long_history_probe_test.dart`, `recovered_identity_probe_test.dart`):
// skipped unless a dart-define asks for it.
//
// THE DELAY IS AGED, NOT WAITED (spec §12 (xxxvi)). §6.2's shortest real path
// is one hour with a valid recovery phrase. This ages
// `identity_reset_requests."deadlineAt"` by direct SQL and then lets the REAL
// per-minute `completeDueResets` sweep authorize the replacement. Forcing
// `status` to `completed` would skip that sweep and prove less.

// Mock-store setup is legitimate here: this file is a test, but `test_e2e/` is
// a sibling of `test/` so the analyzer does not treat it as one.
// ignore_for_file: invalid_use_of_visible_for_testing_member

  // falsification 12 needs two partitions to be non-vacuous — so every reset
  // this suite has ever run happened on an ENROLLED account. A single-device
  // account is the majority shape — and since (lxxiii) made enrolment OPT-IN
  // it is the DEFAULT shape, every user who never linked a second device.
  //
  // Under (lxxiii) the §6.1 lock is not armed for such an account, so a fresh
  // install replaces the identity on credentials alone (`via=unlocked`) under
  // device 1, and a peer that synthesizes device 1 for a non-enrolled account
  // is addressing the device that EXISTS. A §6.2 ceremony could therefore only
  // HARM it: its completion teardown revokes device 1 and allocates id >= 2
  // while the account stays un-enrolled, so every peer keeps synthesizing
  // device 1 and the only live device is unaddressable until it re-enrols
  // ((xlv) clause 2 keeps the server silent, fail-closed, forever). Ruling
  // 2026-09-05: the ceremony is REFUSED for an un-enrolled account, before the
  // phrase is examined. This probe pins that refusal AND the addressability it
  // protects.
