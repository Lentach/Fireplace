/// HTML `<audio>` element — what `just_audio` (`just_audio_web`) uses — registers
/// a MediaSession on play, which on iOS Safari leaves a stale, un-startable
/// media-control card in Control Center / the lock screen for this one-shot
/// sound. Web Audio is the standard pattern for short sound effects and avoids
/// the card entirely.
///
/// **Native:** unchanged — plays via `just_audio`.
///
/// Best-effort: playback failures are swallowed so a sound effect can never
/// surface as an error in the chat UI.

/// receipt — not during a gesture — so this installs a one-shot gesture
/// listener that unlocks the context. Call when a screen that can show a ping
/// opens. No-op off web.
