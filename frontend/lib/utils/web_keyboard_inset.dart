/// was 394 → a ~403px keyboard Flutter never saw). This source computes the real
/// inset as `fullLayoutHeight - visualViewport.height`, where `fullLayoutHeight`

/// PWA shrinks it to the above-keyboard height. Updates on visualViewport
/// resize/scroll.

/// callers can keep using `MediaQuery.viewInsets.bottom`.
