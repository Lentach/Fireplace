// Amendment (lxxviii) clauses 1-2 — WIRE LEVEL, against a real backend and a
// real Postgres.
//
// (lxxviii) turns the recovery phrase from a delay-shortener into a real key
// backup: the phrase seals IK + registrationId + DAK server-side, and a wiped
// install that knows the phrase re-uploads the SAME identity with a
// `restoreSignature` instead of serving a 72 h ceremony. That path deliberately
// bypasses the §6.0 takeover alarm and writes NO `identity_change_audit` row —
// which is precisely why it needs wire-level proof: if the branch predicate
// were wrong, the server would silently accept an identity CHANGE with no
// alarm and no audit trail, and every unit test would stay green.
//
// WHAT ONLY THIS FILE CAN PROVE. `key-bundles.service.spec.ts` mocks the
// authorization repo, so it proves the BRANCH but not the QUERY: it would stay
// green if the restore path read the wrong column, if `recovery_keys.backupBlob`
// were never persisted by `setRecoveryKey`, if the migration 0017 columns were
// missing from the DataSource, or if the OTP purge hit the wrong device. So
// this drives the real socket wire and then reads the server's own tables back.
// The client half is the PRODUCTION `adoptRestoredIdentity`, not a hand-rolled
// install: a restore that re-minted anything would upload a different
// `identityPublicKey`, and the server would then adjudicate an identity CHANGE
// instead of a restore — a divergence a server-only harness cannot see.
//
// THE CONTROLS ARE THE POINT:
//   * a restore proof signed by a DIFFERENT key must be refused
//     (`restore_refused`) and must change NOTHING — otherwise "accepted" only
//     means the server accepts everything;
//   * a restore of the UNCHANGED identity must be accepted — otherwise the
//     refusal above would pass with uploads simply broken;
//   * and the §6.1 identity CHANGE path must still work, so the refusal is
//     pinned to the proof rather than to a globally broken upload.
// All three run the IDENTICAL helper calls; only the signing key differs.
//
// THE CIPHER IS NOT THE CONTRACT HERE. The blob is opaque to the server, and
// this host has no webcrypto native (`flutter pub run webcrypto:setup` needs
// cmake), so the codec runs on injected deterministic primitives — exactly
// like `test/services/device_link/identity_backup_test.dart`, which owns the
// real codec contract. What stays production code is the payload SHAPE, the
// `toWire()` field set, and the seal→store→serve→unseal→adopt loop: the wire
// fields still have to satisfy the server's DTO bounds and the unsealed
// records still have to be the exact strings the stores hold.
//
// WHY IT IS OPT-IN, like the reset and enrolled-lock probes. `/auth/register`
// is 10 per HOUR per IP and every file in `test_e2e/` shares one bucket; the
// default run already spends it to the edge. This file registers TWO accounts,
// so it runs in an isolated pass against a fresh backend — never in the shared
// `test_e2e` run. The production cap is not raised to fit a test.
//
//   docker-compose up
//   cd frontend && flutter test test_e2e/identity_restore_test.dart \
//     --dart-define=RESTORE_PROBE=true

// Mock-store setup is legitimate here: this file is a test, but `test_e2e/` is
// a sibling of `test/` so the analyzer does not treat it as one.
// ignore_for_file: invalid_use_of_visible_for_testing_member
