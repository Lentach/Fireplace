# Session Rules – Summaries

## At the START of each session
1. Read `.cursor/session-summaries/LATEST.md` to learn the context of previous work.
2. Optional: read the latest `YYYY-MM-DD-session.md` files if you need more details.

## At the END of each session
1. Create a new `.cursor/session-summaries/YYYY-MM-DD-session.md` file with today’s date.
2. Write a summary:
   - What was accomplished
   - Key files modified
   - Project status / any notes for the next session
3. Update `.cursor/session-summaries/LATEST.md` – include the date and a link to the new summary.

Do not skip this step – future sessions depend on these summaries.
