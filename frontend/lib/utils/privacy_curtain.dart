/// 80–400 ms between `blur` and the page going hidden (measured on a Pixel_7,
/// 2026-09-06) — not enough for a Flutter frame. The DOM curtain is shown by
/// the page's own `blur`/`visibilitychange` handler, synchronously, while
/// armed; Dart only decides when it is lifted, because lifting it before the
/// return verdict would flash the chat for the frame before a lock lands.
///
/// No-ops off web.
