// The §5.1 provisioning ceremony, as a reusable harness helper.
//
// `full_stack_e2e_test.dart` grew its own copy of this inline, closed over
// alice, because for three tickets alice was the only enrolled account. She is
// no longer: a §6.2 reset is destructive, so it needs an account nothing else
// depends on, and that account still has to link a second device to have more
// than one `(identity, deviceId)` partition to reason about.
//
// Deliberately NOT retro-fitted onto the main suite in the same change. That
// file's ceremony is load-bearing for falsifications 8/18/20 and the T4 group,
// and swapping it out for this while proving something else would put a
// refactor and a proof in one commit.
