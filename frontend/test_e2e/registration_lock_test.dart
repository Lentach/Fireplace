// Phase 0b registration lock + reset ceremony (multi-device spec §6.1/§6.2),
// wire-level against a real backend and a real Postgres.
//
// The mechanism under test is a REFUSAL, and a refusal is exactly what unit
// tests can assert while the deployed server happily accepts everything (wrong
// DTO field name, handler never registered, entity missing from the DataSource
// — the last one shipped in 0a and only the live harness caught it). So this
// drives the real socket wire and then reads the server's own view back to
// confirm nothing moved.
//
// Since amendment (lxxiii) clause 1 the lock is OPT-IN: enrolling a DAK (spec
// §3, `enrollDeviceAuthority`) is what arms it. So the two halves below are
// ordered by enrolment state — first the un-enrolled account, whose identity
// moves on credentials alone but LOUDLY; then the same account enrolled, where
// the identical upload is refused before any write. The §6.1 nonce single-spend
// is no longer observable on the wire (un-enrolled falls through to `unlocked`,
// enrolled refuses the signature path outright per (liv)); it stays pinned by
// the backend unit suite (`chat-key-exchange.service.spec.ts`).
