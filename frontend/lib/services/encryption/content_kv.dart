/// The storage seam under [EncryptionService]'s plaintext-record machinery.
///
/// Every persisted plaintext artifact — decrypted records, the raw replay
/// cache, pending-send records, the purge backlog, retention stamps, the
/// retired-id set — historically went through raw [SharedPreferences]. That
/// backend is being replaced on native (encrypted DB, issue #105 M4) WITHOUT
/// touching the semantics above it: commit-gated removals, the durable purge
/// backlog, two-phase expiry, reconcile, retention, the LRU — all of it was
/// paid for in the field and survives unchanged. So this interface mirrors the
/// exact [SharedPreferences] surface those code paths use, shape for shape:
///
///  * READS ARE SYNCHRONOUS against a loaded view. [SharedPreferences] serves
///    reads from its in-memory cache; the native store loads its records once
///    at open and serves reads the same way. Callers may loop `getString` over
///    thousands of keys without paying a round trip each.
///  * WRITES RETURN THE COMMIT RESULT. `setString`/`remove` answering `false`
///    is load-bearing: a dropped write is how a decrypted message later
///    re-decrypts, hits DuplicateMessage and bricks to a permanent
///    "[Decryption failed]" (see `saveDecryptedContent`). An implementation
///    must never report success for a write it cannot prove committed.
///  * [reload] is the cross-context coherence point. On web, another PWA
///    engine may have written plaintext this engine has not seen; serving a
///    stale snapshot there means a cache miss on a consumed ciphertext. On
///    native there is one process, so it is a no-op.

  /// A snapshot of the BACKING STORE keyed exactly like [getString], or null

  /// WHY THIS EXISTS. [reload] on the prefs backend refills its in-memory cache
  /// from a snapshot taken across an await; a write landing inside that window
  /// survives in the store but is DROPPED from the cache. For a plaintext
  /// record that false miss is not "no plaintext" — the caller re-decrypts a
  /// ciphertext whose Signal ratchet key was consumed at first decrypt, hits
  /// DuplicateMessage, and the row becomes a permanent "[Decryption failed]"
  /// while its only readable copy is still on disk. That shipped as the
  /// 2026-07-29 incident.
  ///
  /// Locking cannot close it: the Signal session stores reload the same
  /// underlying singleton throughout decrypt. So the record readers ask the
  /// backend for ground truth instead, and each backend decides what that
  /// means — which is why this lives here and not in `EncryptionService`.
