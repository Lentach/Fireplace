// The §5.2 layer-2 E2E cross-check (spec §12 amendment (vii), settled by
// (xv)/(xvi)).
//
// `senderListInfo` is a small object the SENDER puts inside the E2E plaintext:
// "this is the version and hash of my own device list, and of yours, as I know
// them". The server never sees, stores or validates it — it rides inside the
// ciphertext — so it can expose a server that serves the two parties DIFFERENT
// but individually-valid, DAK-signed views of a device list (a split view).
//
// The discipline that makes it safe is the whole point (amendment (xvi)):
//
//   * A bare claim NEVER changes trust and NEVER alarms (invariant I7). It is
//     peer-supplied data, and an attacker who could inject it could otherwise
//     weaponise our own warning UI against us.
//   * A claim OLDER than what we hold is a CANDIDATE freeze signal. It becomes
//     a real signal only when our OWN independently-verified, DAK-signed data
//     agrees that the peer is stuck.
//   * A claim NEWER than we hold buys AT MOST ONE rate-limited re-fetch and is
//     then discarded. (Matrix requires one key query in flight per user for
//     exactly this reason: a parallel re-fetch lets a stale answer overwrite a
//     fresh one.)
//   * Skew about OUR OWN devices is benign — it means our devices have not
//     finished syncing — and renders a calm "syncing" state, never the
//     identity-changed surface (amendment (xvii)).
//
// The hash is SHA-256 over the byte-exact DAK-signed `listCanonical` as it was
// transported, never a re-serialization: an unstable encoding would produce
// phantom mismatches, which is precisely why Matrix signs canonical JSON.
