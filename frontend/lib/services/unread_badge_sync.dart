/// the app's reads serialize in one worker instead of racing. The window-context
/// Badging API is only a fallback when the push SW is not registered.

/// Flushes are gated on [ConversationsProvider.hasLoadedConversationsOnce]:
/// before the first server snapshot the local unread map is empty, and writing
/// that "0" would wipe a legitimate badge the SW set while the app was closed.
/// After the first snapshot a zero **is** written — clearing stale badges on
/// read is the whole point (the old `_lastSentCapped != null` guard refused to
/// clear badges the SW wrote, which is why stale counts stuck forever).
