// F4 / KA-02 (spec §12 amendment (lvi)): the (xxxix) expected-identity gate was
// VACUOUS in the two states that are the default rather than the edge.
//
// `_accountIdentityAnchor` resolved the anchor by scanning per-device rows of
// the CACHED verified device list, excluding the device being built, and
// `buildSession` no-ops when the expected identity is null. So the anchor came
// back null — and the §3 account-wide identity binding went unenforced — for:
//
//   1. ANY COLD CACHE. The verified-list cache is memory-only, so every first
//      send after launch resolved nothing.
//   2. ANY SINGLE-LIVE-DEVICE PEER. `notEnrolled()` synthesises device 1 alone,
//      so the only candidate IS the device being built, and it is skipped. That
//      is every non-enrolled account — i.e. most users.
//
// These tests drive the REAL provider `ensureSession` against a server that
// serves a FOREIGN identity key for a peer whose real key this device already
// pinned. That is exactly the capability §2 says a server alone does not have.
//
// WHAT EACH TEST IS FOR:
//   1. cold cache: the substitution is REFUSED, not silently trusted
//   2. cold cache: the refusal is VISIBLE ((lv)), or it is just a dead chat
//   3. single-live-device peer: same refusal on the most common account shape
//   4. POSITIVE CONTROL: the peer's OWN key still builds on a cold cache — the
//      fix must not block ordinary messaging, which is the whole risk of (lvi)
//   5. POSITIVE CONTROL: genuine first contact with an ACCOUNT stays TOFU
//
// Everything here is a real production object except the socket transport.
